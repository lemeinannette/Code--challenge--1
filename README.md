# Challenge Solutions

This repository contains solutions to three coding challenges. Each challenge addresses a different problem and includes a Python function that provides a solution.

## Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time
Given an hour (in the range of 1 to 12), a minute (in the range of 0 to 59), and a period (either "am" or "pm"), the function `convert_to_24_hour` converts the time to 24-hour format.

## Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive
The function `two_positive` takes three integers as arguments and returns True if exactly two of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and False otherwise.

## Challenge 3: Consonant value
Given a lowercase string without spaces, the function `solve` returns the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou".
